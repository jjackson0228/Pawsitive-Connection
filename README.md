# Pawsitive Connection

Pawsitive Connection is a web application designed to help connect adoptable pets with loving families. The platform offers an intuitive interface where users can browse available pets, filter search results, save favorite pets to their profile, and make donations to support animal shelters. Our mission is to promote pet adoption and encourage people to adopt rather than shop for pets.

# Project Overview

Pawsitive Connection is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and incorporates GraphQL for efficient data querying. The app provides users with an engaging and user-friendly experience, including functionalities like pet search, pet details, a donation system via Stripe, and more.
