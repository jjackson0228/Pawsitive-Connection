# Pawsitive Connection

Pawsitive Connection is a web application designed to help connect adoptable pets with loving families. The platform offers an intuitive interface where users can browse available pets, filter search results, save favorite pets to their profile, and make donations to support animal shelters. Our mission is to promote pet adoption and encourage people to adopt rather than shop for pets.

# Project Overview

Pawsitive Connection is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and incorporates GraphQL for efficient data querying. The app provides users with an engaging and user-friendly experience, including functionalities like pet search, pet details, a donation system via Stripe, and more.

# Features

- Browse Adoptable Pets: Users can explore a wide selection of adoptable pets, each with detailed information like age, breed, color, and more.

- Search and Filter: Users can search for pets by type, age, or color to quickly find the perfect match.

- Pet Details Page: Each pet has a dedicated details page with more in-depth information, including an option to add the pet to the user’s profile.

- Save Favorite Pets: Users can save pets they’re interested in to their profile for easy access and reference.

- Donation System: Support animal shelters by donating through a secure, integrated Stripe payment option.

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profile and saved pets.

- Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
